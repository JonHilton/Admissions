Admissions
==========

I work in a medical admissions unit. We see all the patients which are being admitted to hospital either via A&E or from their GP. The system we use at the moment to keep track of this is a pen and paper list, which at the end of the shift is transcribed to an Excell spreadsheet. That spreadsheet is printed off and used to tell the next shift of doctors who is sick and needs reviewing.

As a system, it doesn't work very well. But it is simple enough to make up for it's misgivings. 

I thought I'd try to make something which works better but retains the ease of use.
